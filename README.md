## Overview
This repository contains a collection of advanced Generative AI solutions, from prompt design to production deployment (MLOps).

## Project Roadmap
The projects in this repository are structured sequentially to build complexity step-by-step. It is recommended to explore them in the following order:

1.  **[reader_digest](./reader_digest)**
    * *Focus:* Displays a summary of web pages
2.  **[digital_brochure](./digital_brochure)**
    * *Focus:* automates the creation of marketing collateral
3.  **[technical_tutor](./technical_tutor)**
    * *Focus:* A flexible educational tool that allows developers to have an AI mentor always available, whether leveraging the power of the cloud or the privacy of their own machine.
4.  **[consumption_frontier_models](./consumption_frontier_models)**
    * *Focus:* Exploring and Using Frontier Model APIs
5.  **[interactive_interface](./interactive_interface)**
    * *Focus:* Unified Multi-LLM Streaming Hub — A centralized Gradio interface to interact with, compare, and stream responses from top-tier models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) in real-time.
6.  **[conversational_chatbot](./conversational_chatbot)**
    * *Focus:* A conversational chatbot that can be used to interact with a LLM
7.  **[airline_assistant](./airline_assistant)**
    * *Focus:* An airline assistant that can be used to interact with a LLM
8.  **[huggingface_pipelines](./huggingface_pipelines)**
    * *Focus:* Google Colab - The High Level API for using open-source models for typical inference tasks is called "pipelines". It's incredibly easy to use.
9.  **[tokenizers](./tokenizers)**
    * *Focus:* Google Colab - Tokenizers are a crucial component of any NLP pipeline. They are used to convert text into a format that can be processed by a model.
10. **[models](./models)**
    * *Focus:* Google Colab - Models are the core component of any NLP pipeline. They are used to process text into a format that can be used for inference.
